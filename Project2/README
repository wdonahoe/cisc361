Usage: ./scheduler <input_file.txt> <FCFS | RR> <Half of cs> <quantum>

===================================================================================

Make sure there are not more than two newline characters at the end of the input file.

====================================================================================

- A context switch occurs whenever a process is put on the cpu and when it is taken off to wait.
- A context switch does not occur when the final process terminates.

So with the following input;

0 2 10 8 10
5 2 5 6 5

we get the following output on a FCFS scheduler:

(CS) RUN 10 (CS) (WAIT 8) (CS) RUN 5 (CS) (WAIT 6) (CS) RUN 10 (CS) RUN 5
